# {{PROBLEM}} Multi-Class Planned Design Recipe

## 1. Describe the Problem

> As a customer
> So that I can check if I want to order something
> I would like to see a list of dishes with prices.

> As a customer
> So that I can order the meal I want
> I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes.

> As a customer
> So that I can verify that my order is correct
> I would like to see an itemised receipt with a grand total.

Use the `twilio-ruby` gem to implement this next one. You will need to use doubles too.

> As a customer
> So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
> I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered.


## 2. Design the Class System

_Consider diagramming out the classes and their relationships. Take care to
focus on the details you see as important, not everything. The diagram below
uses asciiflow.com but you could also use excalidraw.com, draw.io, or miro.com_

```
![test](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bwilton93/takeaway-solo-project/main/images/class-system-design.png "test")
```

_Also design the interface of each class in more detail._

```ruby

```

## 3. Create Examples as Integration Tests

_Create examples of the classes being used together in different situations and
combinations that reflect the ways in which the system will be used._

```ruby

```

## 4. Create Examples as Unit Tests

_Create examples, where appropriate, of the behaviour of each relevant class at
a more granular level of detail._

```ruby

```

## 5. Implement the Behaviour

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green,
refactor to implement the behaviour._
